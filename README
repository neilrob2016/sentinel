Compiling
=========
Just type "make". If you get any sound.cc related compilation errors (eg on
OS/X) comment out the line "SOUND=-DSOUND" in the Makefile.


Storyline
=========
This is a game losely based on a cross between Defender, Scramble and some game
on the BBC Micro whose name escapes me. The idea is that you have to rescue all
the men trapped in pods on the surface of the planet by grabbing them with a
tractorbeam and take them back to the moonbase (the place you take off from at 
the start of the level). Each pod you save regains you 5 points of lost health
(max health = 100). 
   Meanwhile gryppers launched from the enemy lairs want to do the same. If the
enemy capture them they become prisoners and are eventually relaunch as zombies
who attempt to ram you. However there are plenty of other nasties waiting out
there for you which you will discover soon enough.


Weapons
=======
You start with a single laser (upgradable via a powerup in later levels) but
there are numerous bombs scattered around the landscape. They have a number 
which slowly increases as the level goes on and this number is measure of
their destructive power but also their weight. So the more blast power they
have the heavier they are to carry. Their detonation timer starts as soon as
you drop them and they explode after 2 seconds.


Powerups
========
These appear as floating icons. More appear as you progress up the levels.

Tractorbeam - This restores your tractorbeam to full power
Hyperspace  - This gives you another hyperspace jump
Shield      - With this press control-R to activate shield. This powerup is
              removed if your ship is destroyed.
Laser       - Gives you a double laser. Ditto shield if ship is destroyed.
Health      - Restores health (max = 100) based on level * 10 (eg level 6 = 60)
Reverse G   - Reverse the pull of gravity. May help or hinder you!


Level   To complete level
=====   =================
1       Rescue pods, kill all zombies
2       Rescue pods, kill all zombies
3       As 2 plus destroy 2 cannon
4       As 2 plus destroy all cannon
5       As 2 plus destroy 2 lairs
6+      As 2 plus destroy all lairs


Miscellanous game info
======================
- The radar only shows 60% of the landscape at any time
- Gravity starts to get stronger from level 6 onwards
- If all pods are captured by the enemy everything runs faster and bouncing off
  a hill costs you health
- Bombs get more powerful but heavier as a level progresses. They are reset
  on level re-start or a new level.
- Bombs should be used to destroy the heavily armoured lairs.
- Bombing a lair makes it release 1 prisoner as a pod
- Destroying a lair releases all prisoners as pods unless all pods have been
  captured in which case they are releases as zombies.
- If you pass through a Disruptors field you will drop all your cargo 
  (pods/bombs) and lose health. 
- When a Disruptor is destroyed the gravity field is disturbed and zero 
  gravity ensues for a while. This will allow you to carry heavy bombs on
  higher levels.
- Your ship may carry a maximum of 3 items but if the weight is too much it
  won't be able to tow them all.
- Pods and bombs being carried are vulnerable to enemy fire.
- If you rescue all pods then the all pods saved bonus = 1500 + 500 * level
- If you gain an extra hyperspace trip due to a powerup this won't be counted
  if the number of trips increases in the next level. eg if you gain a trip
  in level 3 (default = 1) which will give you 2 trips and advance to level
  4 (default = 2) your trip count will remain at 2. Why? Its a lot of trouble
  to fix for such a small feature. :o)


Keys
====
S          - start
P          - pause
Escape     - quit

Up arrow   - thrust
A          - increase thrust
Z          - decrease thrust
L&R arrows - rotate ship

Shift keys - fire laser
Control-R  - use shield powerup (if available)

Tab/Alt    - grab pod or bomb
Spacebar   - drop everything
D          - drop bottom item only

H          - hyperspace
V          - sound on/off


Sound
=====
The sound system can use either the old OpenSound system (which IMO is better
for games - less latency, no buffer underrun and no mysteriously "dropped"
sounds) or ALSA. Note that this is a compilation not runtime option. To have
any sound at all the SOUND macro must be included in the Makefile and to
specifically use Alsa the ALSA macro must also be defined else it defaults to
compiling in OpenSound.

The OpenSound system writes directly to the /dev/audio or /dev/dsp device.
This means if something else is using that then the game won't be able to
and you'll see a "Device or resource busy" error. To get around this use the 
"aoss" command. eg: "aoss sen"


Operating systems
=================
This game will compile and run on Linux & FreeBSD and should work on OS/X
though sound will only work on Linux so if you're running something else 
comment out the SOUND=-DSOUND in the Makefile. The binary created is called
"sen".



Bugs/Issues
===========
- Static objects on roof occasionally appear in the same location at start
- Laser beams can sometimes travel inside the ground
- Some game timing issues on certain X installations. If the game appears to
  be running slowly or response to key presses appears delayed then reduce the
  window size or use the -ref option to reduce the framerate.
